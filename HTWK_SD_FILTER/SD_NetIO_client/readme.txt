 * \page page_demo_udp Demo UDP Filter
 *
 * Implements a UDP filter
 * 
 * \par Location
 * \code
 *    ./src/examples/src/filters/demo_udp/
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Build Environment
 * To see how to set up the build environment have a look at this page @ref page_cmake_overview
 *
 * \par This example shows:
 * \li how to implement a common ADTF Filter for processing data
 * \li how to deal with a received MediaSample to get the specific data
 * \li how to send or receive data over a socket
 *
 * \par Call Sequence
 * For a better understanding of the sequence of calls while using base device
 * classes of ADTF SDK, the ethernet device implementations are added to the
 * installation as source files.\n
 * So you can debug through the call sequence.
